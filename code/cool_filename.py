# import data set and handle missing values

# choose a random date.

# take 30 historic days before the data
# keep these stored to plot them later against the trained model

# get next week to get the actual data later to compare the predictions against

# train on historic data.

# plot the trained models against the data they were trained on
# together with least squares measures(in order to experiment with diff linear models)

# plot the predicted values (by the model) against the actual prices for that week
# it is this prediction that we'll feed to the scheduler

# Feed the predicted data to the scheduler and calculate the cost
